                <label><Lang>Subscriptions and Pricing Policy</Lang></label>
                <p><Lang>Digital Morocco offers its Users the opportunity to subscribe to monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, or annual subscriptions to access advanced features of the Platform, providing them with a more comprehensive and personalized experience. The rates for these subscriptions are clearly displayed on the websites, allowing Users to choose the plan that best suits their needs and budget.</Lang></p>
                <p><Lang>By subscribing to a plan, the User acknowledges and agrees to pay the fees associated with their chosen plan, in accordance with the payment terms specified upon subscription. It is important to note that subscription rates may vary depending on the features included and the benefits offered in each plan.</Lang></p>
                <p><Lang>The User also understands that subscriptions are automatically renewed at the end of each billing period unless the User decides to cancel their subscription before the renewal date. Details regarding cancellation and refund conditions are clearly specified in the Terms of Use.</Lang></p>
                <p><Lang>Digital Morocco is committed to providing quality service to its subscribers and ensuring transparency and clarity in the pricing and terms associated with subscriptions. Any changes in subscription rates or features will be communicated to Users proactively, enabling them to make informed decisions regarding their subscription.</Lang></p>
                <p><Lang>Digital Morocco operates on a subscription-based business model, supplemented by the purchase of credits according to each user's specific needs. Upon registration, each new user is graciously allocated a starting credit of 5 units, allowing them to fully explore our platform. By opting for one of our subscription offers, the User receives a predetermined number of credits based on the chosen plan.</Lang></p>
                <p><Lang>These credits play a crucial role in the user experience, enabling the activation of various essential platform features. These include account validation to access all available features, unlocking advanced features for personalized use, or initiating contact with investors to develop business partnerships.</Lang></p>
                <p><Lang>To ensure total transparency to our Users, our credit debit policy is rigorously defined:</Lang></p>
                <p>
                <ul>
                    <li><Lang>Each validation of a project sheet results in a debit of 1 credit from the User's account, thereby ensuring efficient and transparent management of projects on our platform.</Lang></li>
                    <li><Lang>In the event of an investor's refusal following contact, the debit is 5 credits, reflecting the cost of this action.</Lang></li>
                    <li><Lang>In the event of acceptance of the contact by the investor, the debit amounts to 6 credits, thus rewarding fruitful interaction and encouraging users to develop beneficial professional relationships.</Lang></li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p><Lang>Additionally, our credits are cumulative on a monthly basis and remain valid for a total period of 12 months, thus offering our Users optimal flexibility to use their credits according to their needs and pace.</Lang></p>
                <p><Lang>This policy aims to ensure our Users a smooth and transparent experience on our platform, highlighting the value of each interaction and allowing them to manage their credits effectively throughout their journey with Digital Morocco.</Lang></p>

            <div className=''>
                <label><Lang>Cancellation of Subscriptions</Lang></label>
                <p><Lang>At Digital Morocco, we acknowledge the necessity of providing our Users with adequate flexibility regarding subscription cancellations to accommodate their evolving needs and potential circumstances. With this in mind, we have implemented a cancellation policy designed to ensure an optimal user experience while adhering to our contractual commitments.</Lang></p>
                <p><Lang>The User is thus entitled to cancel their subscription at any time. Such cancellation results in the cessation of contractual obligations associated with the ongoing subscription while allowing the User to continue enjoying the included features until the end of the current billing period.</Lang></p>
                <p><Lang>To exercise this right, the User may access their personal space on the Digital Morocco platform and follow the cancellation procedures clearly outlined therein. Once this process is completed, no additional fees will be charged, and access to paid features will remain available until the end of the aforementioned billing period.</Lang></p>
                <p><Lang>It is worth noting, however, that our cancellation policy does not include prorated refunds for unused portions of the cancelled subscription period. Consequently, the User will not be entitled to any refund for the remaining portion of the current billing period following the cancellation of their subscription. Nevertheless, access to paid features will be maintained until the expiration of said period.</Lang></p>
                <p><Lang>At Digital Morocco, our priority is to ensure a transparent and hassle-free user experience. Therefore, we remain available to our Users to address any questions regarding subscription cancellations or to provide any necessary assistance. Our dedicated support team stands ready to assist them in this process, in compliance with our contractual commitments and applicable legal provisions.</Lang></p>

                <label><Lang>Right of Withdrawal</Lang></label>
                <p><Lang>In accordance with the applicable legal provisions, every User is entitled to a right of withdrawal for subscriptions made on the Digital Morocco platform, subject to the conditions outlined below.</Lang></p>
                <p><Lang>No refund will be granted, and no right of withdrawal can be exercised in the following cases:</Lang></p>
                <p>
                <ul style={{listStyleType: 'lower-alpha' }}>
                    <li><Lang>In the event of validation of a project profile and the debiting of credits for unlocking the list of investors, the User acknowledges and expressly consents that such validation and debit constitute an irrevocable acceptance of the services provided by the Platform. Consequently, no right of withdrawal or subsequent refund can be exercised or granted.</Lang></li>
                    <li><Lang>If the 7-day period following the subscription to the subscription is exceeded, even in the absence of account usage, the User is informed that the legally provided withdrawal period has expired. As a result of this expiration, no refund will be granted, in accordance with the prevailing legislation.</Lang></li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p><Lang>To exercise their right of withdrawal, the User must ensure that their project profile is not validated or incomplete. In this situation, no credits will be debited, and no list of investors will be unlocked. The User will then be fully reimbursed in accordance with the Platform's withdrawal policy.</Lang></p>
                <p><Lang>The User acknowledges that the right of withdrawal is contingent upon the non-validation of their project profile and the non-debiting of credits for unlocking the list of investors. Any other case of project profile validation or credit debit automatically excludes the right of withdrawal and any subsequent refund.</Lang></p>
                <p><Lang>The precise procedures for exercising the right of withdrawal are defined in these General Terms of Use and must be adhered to by the User. It is recommended that the User carefully review them to fully understand their rights and obligations regarding subscription withdrawal.</Lang></p>
                <p><Lang>The Platform is committed to ensuring transparency and respecting the rights of its Users. In case of questions regarding the right of withdrawal or to exercise this right, the User is encouraged to contact the dedicated support team, which is available to provide any necessary assistance.</Lang></p>
